I'm Topi, a software developer from Turku, Finland.

I enjoy creating software that's easy to use, easy to introduce and accessible.
Currently employed by Identio I focus my skills on web and app development via consulting.

I recently graduated with a Master's Degree in Software Engineering, finishing my studies while working full time.
