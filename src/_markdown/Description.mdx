My name is Topi, and I'm a software engineer working mainly in web and app development.
I am fascinated by the graphical side of things, which is why I find enjoyment in creating software
that's easy to use, easy to introduce and accessible.

I'm currently employed by Identio Oy in Turku, Finland as a software consultant,
using my skills to make my customers happy with their projects.
