Welcome!

I'm Topi, a web developer from Turku, Finland.

Currently, I'm employed by NordicEdu where I enjoy creating educational games
and motivating users with gamification.

I also have my Master's Thesis on the way, hopefully
completing my degree by Q2 2021. It's about gamifying
tutorials in b2b applications.
