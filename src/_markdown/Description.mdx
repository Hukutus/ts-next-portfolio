Welcome!

I'm Topi, a web developer, from Turku, Finland.

Currently employed by Identio I focus my skills on web and app development.
I enjoy creating software that's easy to use and easy to introduce not forgetting about accessibility.
Using my prior knowledge learned from working at NordicEdu I'm often thinking about gamification as way to motivate users.

I recently graduated with a Master's Degree in Software Engineering, finishing my studies while working full time.
