Welcome!

I'm Topi, a web developer from Turku, Finland.

Currently employed by Identio I focus my skills on web and app development.
I like software that's easy to use and easy to introduce not forgetting about accessibility and a pinch of gamification.

I still have my Master's Thesis on the way, finishing my degree while working full time during Q4 2021.
My thesis is about researching game tutorials and using those to make the introduction process of smoother in B2B software.
