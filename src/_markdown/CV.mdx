# Topi Salonen
#### Software Engineer, Web and App Developer

## Experience

### Software Engineer | Identio Oy | 2021-

As a software consultant I have been working in customer projects, currently doing app development in a team of around 10 other skilled personalities.
I'm enjoying the change in working in a much bigger team with well implemented sprints and plans.
My current learning objectives focus on UX problems like accessibility and usability.
I've already learned a ton of new things about things like testing and container, but I'm anxious to learn more.

### Software Developer | NordicEdu Oy | 2017-2021

My tasks consisted of developing gamified web and app projects for both customers and in-house.
Most of my employment focused on development of a B2B SaaS project, where my responsibilities as a mainly solo developer ranged from code to design to project management, which means the work was as full-stack as you can get.
This position helped me learn greatly about the different aspects of development, which I am very grateful for.
I worked close to our customers wanting to fulfill their dreams to the best of my skills solving all kinds of tricky problems.
