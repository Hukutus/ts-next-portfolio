## Experience

### Identio Oy | 2021-

As a software consultant I'm working with customer projects, currently doing app development in a team of 20-ish skilled people.
I'm enjoying the change in working in a much bigger team. My current learning objectives focus on the architecture side, usability and most of all accessibility.

### NordicEdu Oy | 2017-2021

My tasks consisted of developing gamified web and app projects, from design to code and from servers to UI/UX.

I worked close to our customers aiming to fulfill their wildest dreams, solving all kinds of tricky problems in both tech and usability.
