### HSL App

![Alt text](/hsl_img.png)
Most people residing in Finland are likely to be familiar with the application, but in short HSL App is the application used for purchasing tickets for buses and trains in Helsinki, Finland and nearby areas.
It also comes with route planning and other features to help you navigate the Helsinki area.
The HSL App is the first project I've worked on that has a massive amount of daily users and money transactions.
