#### The product

People that have visited the capital of Finland, Helsinki, are likely already familiar with the HSL app.
In short, HSL App is the application used for purchasing tickets for local buses and trains in Helsinki and nearby areas. It also comes with route planning.

#### My role

My work has focused on developing the app and its proxy server that connects the app to all the different services.
When I started, the main goal was accessibility to reach WCAG compliance.
After that I've worked on many new features, fixed a ton of bugs, created multiple releases and upgraded React Native several times.

#### Conclusion

During my years in the project, I've noticed I thrive in problem-solving.
It has been exciting to work on a large project with about a million active users.
