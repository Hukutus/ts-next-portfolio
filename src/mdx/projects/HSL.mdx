#### The product

HSL App is an application for the public transportation in the Helsinki metropolitan area.
It's mainly used for purchasing tickets and route planning in the Helsinki area, but it also includes news and other useful features for visitors.

#### My role

My work has focused on developing the app and its proxy server that connects the app to different HSL services.
When I joined the project, the main goal was improving accessibility to reach WCAG compliance.
I have also worked on many new features, fixed a ton of bugs, upgraded dependencies and created multiple releases.

#### Conclusion

During my years in the project, I've noticed I thrive in problem-solving.
It has been exciting to work on a large project with about a million active users.
