**Motivation**

Everyone needs a portfolio, and it allows you to spend a lot of time trying out random stuff.
I'd say this is around the 4th version I've made, but also the only one that actually has some proper content.

**Technical stuff**

I wanted the page to be light and fast, so I went with **Next.js**.
It comes with image optimization, easy SEO, and it's pretty much **React**, which made it feel like an obvious choice.
All the portfolio pages are made using **MDX**, which allows me to easily add more content with identical styling.

**TODO or not TODO**

I need to keep doing interesting stuff to show off here.

export default PortfolioLayout;
