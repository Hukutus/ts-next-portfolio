**Motivation**

I feel like everyone needs a portfolio of some sort when they start their career. I didn't really have any big plans and instead just wanted to create something slick and simple.
I'd say this is around the 4th version of the portfolio I've made, but only the first one I have released with content.

**Technical stuff**

I wanted a light and fast page that allows for full customisation. I was already slightly familiar with **Next.js**, so I wanted to give it a go.
Next.js comes with image optimization, easy SEO, and it's pretty much **React**, which made it easy for me to approach.

All the portfolio pages are written using **MDX**, which allows me to easily add more content with matching styles.

export default PortfolioLayout;
