**Description**

LOGE is the main project I worked on at **NordicEdu**, created with and for **TalentVectia**.

LOGE is a lightly gamified platform where organizations can arrange discussions on strategy, values, or basically anything else.
One of the cool things about LOGE is that when you attend a discussion you won't know who you're participating with beforehand,
so if you're working in a big organization you'll likely be discussing with co-workers you have never worked with before.

When I started as an intern at NordicEdu in 2017 the first version LOGE had just been released.
It still does the same core functions, but the UI and UX sides have been updated several times
and there's a ton of new features that have been added during the few years I've worked on the project.
I'd say around 80% of the current code base is written by me (even the spaghetti).

**Technical stuff**

LOGE uses the **MEAN-stack (Mongo, Express, Angular, Node)** with the latest version of Angular.

For the real-time discussions we use sockets. We started out with plain **WebSockets**, but later
"upgraded" them to **Socket.io** as we wanted to have a proper room system and more reliable handling of reconnection.
These could have both been done with WebSockets, but with Socket.io we didn't have to do it ourselves.

In LOGE 1.0 you had to use an external conferencing software like **Teams**,
but the aim was to have our own **WebRTC** conferencing. We have encountered and solved a ton of problems caused by
our limited knowledge of WebRTC during the past couple of years.
Many problems were also caused by firewalls and by microphones not being connected or being muted.
The first version of the voice chat was purely P2P, but nowadays the voice track is sent to a dedicated RTC server that forwards the speech to other participants.
This is done with the **mediasoup** SFU. We also have a **TURN** server on the side to get around those pesky corporate firewalls.

**TODO or not TODO**

I'm not going to list our plans here, sorry!
