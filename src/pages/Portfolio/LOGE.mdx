**Description**

**LOGE** is the main project I worked on during my time at **NordicEdu**, created with and for **TalentVectia** (nowadays known as **Verona Consulting**).

LOGE is a lightly gamified web platform where organizations can arrange live discussions on various topics.
One of my favourite features of LOGE is that when you attend a discussion you won't always know who you're participating with beforehand.
For a large organizations this means the participants will likely be discussing the given topic with co-workers they have never worked with before.

The first version LOGE had just been released when I started as an intern in NordicEdu at the beginning of 2017.
The core functionality is still the same to this day, but the platform has seen many reworks and new features since its release.

When I first started with the LOGE project I was very lost about many things as this was my first real world customer project.
After some years of learning I was doing pretty much everything the project needed from project management to design to implementation.

When I left NordicEdu in 2021 I would say nearly 90% of the project's code was written by me (even the bad code).

**Technical stuff**

LOGE is written using the **MEAN-stack (Mongo, Express, Angular, Node)**.

For the real-time discussion functionality LOGE uses web sockets. The real-time communication feature was released using plain **WebSockets**,
but later on the functionality was upgraded to use **Socket.io** since it came with many features that allowed for more reliable connections between users.

In the original version of LOGE you had to use an external conferencing software like **Skype**,
but because it was always such a hassle for the users we started implementing a custom conferencing solution with **WebRTC**.

We encountered and solved a ton of problems caused by our limited knowledge of WebRTC during the past couple of years it was used.
Many problems were caused by corporate firewalls and by microphones not being connected or being muted.
The first version of the voice chat was purely peer-to-peer, which caused some users to sometimes hear some but not all participants.

After an upgrade to a dedicated **mediasoup** RTC server we started sending the voice tracks to the server that forwarded the data to all the other participants,
which meant that if a participant heard you speaking then everyone other participant did as well.
A separate **TURN** server is also required for the voice chat to work with pesky corporate firewalls.

I have to say I'm really proud that the we managed to create a properly working voice conferencing feature.
