**Motivation**

I'm really into modern board games, and my collection keeps growing year after year.
Wingspan is a board game from 2019 where the aim is to play birds that do stuff birds do, like laying eggs or eating other birds (for points!).

The cool thing about Wingspan is that each bird is unique. So if you play a Black-Bellied Whistling-Duck, you can be sure no one else will have one.
I have no idea what most birds sound like, so I wanted to try creating a soundboard that has all the different birds you can find in Wingspan.

**Technical stuff**

This soundboard was made with **React** and **TypeScript** since I hadn't used React before and mainly used Angular in my work. No functional programming here though. I also used **Firebase** to hold all the bird data, and to not do an excessive amount of API calls to the public bird API.

User **TawnyFrogmouth** on **BoardGameGeek** (the biggest board gaming website) shared a sheet with data of all the Wingspan birds, which made starting out really easy.
For the sounds, I found a bird enthusiast site called **Xeno Canto** that has a ton of user-submitted recordings of bird songs and a public API.

In short, the soundboard works like any other soundboard: by pressing a button to play a sound. If a bird's song is already stored in **Firestore** the app will play one of the previously stored songs. If not, the app queries **Xeno Canto** instead, play it, and stores the song into **Firestore**.

**TODO or not TODO**

The UI is hideous. I was going to build a properly styled front-end, but lost motivation.
So I'd like to still add a stylized UI with pictures.
The game also has two expansions with more coming, so there are more birds to add (I hope there's an updated sheet).

It seems like I never added proper source control, so there's no source code for now.
