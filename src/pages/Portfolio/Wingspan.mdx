**Motivation**

One of my favourite pastimes is playing modern board games, and my game collection keeps growing larger year after year.

In the simplest terms Wingspan is a bird themed board game where the aim is to gather birds. The cool thing is every bird is unique and represents a real bird from around the world.
So if you for example have a [Black-Bellied Whistling-Duck](https://www.google.com/search?q=black-bellied+whistling-duck) in your hand, you can be sure no one else has one.
I'm not a birdwatcher hobbyist, which means most of the birds in the game are completely unknown to me.

I stumbled upon a post on **BoardGameGeek**, a popular board gaming website, by the user **TawnyFrogmouth** who shared a data sheet with a list of all the Wingspan birds,
after which I knew I had to create a soundboard which could play the song of every bird in the game.

**Technical stuff**

This soundboard was made with **React** and **TypeScript**. When I started this project I had not used React before, so I was not ready to yet start with functional programming. I also used **Firebase** to store all the bird songs to not do an excessive amount of API calls to the public bird API.

With the data sheet mentioned before I just had to find a way to collect all the bird songs. Without much effort I found a bird enthusiast site called **Xeno Canto** that has a wide array of user-submitted recordings of bird songs and a public API I could use to find these songs programmatically.
The soundboard works like any old soundboard: you press a button to play a sound. If a bird's song is already stored in the site's database the app will play one of the previously stored songs. If not, the app queries the **Xeno Canto** API instead, plays it, and stores the song in **Firestore**.

**Future improvements**

- The UI is hideous. I was going to build a properly styled front-end, but my vision was a tad bid too complex so that I didn't find the motivation to finalise it.
- Xeno Canto also provides photos of birds, which could be used for the UI.
- There have been expansions released for the game that come with new unique birds, so there are birds songs to be added.
- The connection to the Xeno Canto API seems to have broken, which means you can no longer query new songs
