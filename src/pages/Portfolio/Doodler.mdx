**Motivation**

While working for NordicEdu we often played games during coffee breaks. One of those games go by the name **Scribbl.io**.

When I was younger I enjoyed a game called *Kuva-arvoitus* from a Finnish Java game site called **Aapeli** (they shut down a couple of years ago, likely because of the whole Java thing).
I played that game a lot.

So, why not try to make a drawing app myself? Can't be that hard.

**Technical stuff**

This is another OOP **React** project with no planned back-end (yet).
I basically wanted to have the option to draw on the screen using the mouse with different colors and brushes.

The end result is quite simple, since it's a **canvas** element that listens to mouse move during mouse-down, and draws lines between points.

**TODO or not TODO**

Since the canvas draws a line between each point the app draws a ton of extra lines and won't work with opacity.
I'd need to remove the previous lines and just draw one line to replace it, going through all the points the mouse has been in.

I'd like to add a social aspect, where users could see each other draw. This could be done with **WebSockets** or by using **Firebase**.
