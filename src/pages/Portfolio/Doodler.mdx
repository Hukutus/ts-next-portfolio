**Motivation**

While working for NordicEdu we often played games during coffee breaks. One of those games was a drawing game called **Scribbl.io**.
When I was younger I enjoyed a game called *Kuva-arvoitus* from a Finnish game site called **Aapeli** (they shut down some years ago).
I remember spending hours and hours playing that game.

So I thought why not to create my own drawing app.
I mainly wanted to have a simple canvas to draw on with different colors and shapes by using the mouse.

**Technical stuff**

This is another simple **React** project with no plans for a backend.
The drawing board is a **HTML canvas** element that listens to the mouse move during the mouse-down event, and then draws a line between the points.
I hadn't used canvas before, so this was an interesting exercise.

**Future improvements**

- Sockets to allow multiplayer
- Allow setting opacity (current implementation doesn't really support it)

export default PortfolioLayout;
