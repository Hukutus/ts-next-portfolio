**Description**

**HSL App** was my first project when starting working for **Identio** as a consultant.

Most people residing in Finland are likely to be familiar with the application, but in short HSL App is the application used for purchasing tickets for buses and trains in Helsinki, Finland and nearby areas.
It also comes with route planning and other features to help you navigate the Helsinki area.
The HSL App is the first project I've worked on that has a massive amount of daily users and money transactions.

During my time at the project I have learned a ton about app development, accessibility and testing.

**Techical stuff**

The HSL App is written with **React Native** and combined with a **GraphQL** server used for connecting the app with multiple different HSL backend services.

At the beginning of time working on the project that tasks were mostly focused on the accessibility side of the application due to a new law in Finland called the *Act on the Provision of Digital Services*, which requires all public services to be accessible.
In simplified terms this means you must be able to properly use the application with a screen reader or a keyboard.
This was a great learning opportunity for me as I hadn't really implemented any accessibility features in my earlier projects.

The sheer amount of users and the requirement for the app to work at all times the buses and trains are running means the project has required code reviews, a multi-part release process with a lot of automated tests and even a separate testing team.
I've also learned that in app development it is a lot harder to hotfix things compared to web development, which means your code has to be mint.
