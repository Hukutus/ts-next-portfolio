**Motivation**

This is another hobby project about board gaming (the other being [Wingspan soundboard](/Portfolio/Wingspan)).
During game nights the same two questions always pop up: *What should we play?* and *What should we play next?*.
In the end everyone brings a ton of games, but we just don't have the time to play them all.

To try to make planning easier I came up with an idea *Tinder-ish app for board games*, which could combine all the games
from each of the participants' game collections to allow the participants to decide some the games to play beforehand.

The app can be used to create a game night with specific players, after which the all the participants can vote for their favourites.
Most boardgames have recommended and best amount of players, which can be used to filter out games that don't fit for the number of participants.
These features could possibly reduce the time needed to figure out what each player wants to play.

**Technical stuff**

**React + TypeScript** is currently my usual go-to for hobby projects since it's a familiar combination,
but this time I went with **React Native** to keep focus on the mobile side of things and to challenge myself.
I intended to keep the app usable in a browser with **react-native-web**, but gave up with the plan once I started encountering issues with the library.

Many of my board gaming friends use a website called **BoardGameGeek** to keep track of their game collections.
The site also has a public XML API that can used to fetch game collections belonging to specific users.

**Future improvements**

- Voting has not yet been fully implemented, so you can only view the game collections of users
- There should be some kind of authentication for being allowed to join a game night
- Needs a proper UI
