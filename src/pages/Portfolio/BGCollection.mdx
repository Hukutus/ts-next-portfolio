**Motivation**

This is another hobby project about board gaming (the other being [Wingspan soundboard](/Portfolio/Wingspan)).
When scheduling game nights the same question keeps popping up almost every time: *What should we play?*.
In the end everyone brings a ton of games, but we play only few of them.

To make this easier I came up with an idea *Tinder-ish thing for board games*.
We could combine all the games from the participants' collections, sort them by the best player count, and let people vote on their favorites.

**Technical stuff**

**React + TypeScript** is my usual go-to for my hobby projects, but this time I used **React Native** (with TypeScript) and functional programming.
I got my first real taste of FP at work when we started a new **React Native** project at work, and after being very confused for a while I started enjoying it.
There's isn't any other reason why I used React Native other than to challenge myself. I intend to keep the app usable in a browser with **react-native-web**.

Most of our gaming group uses **BoardGameGeek** (BGG) to keep their game collection, and BGG happens to have a public API. The annoying part: it's an XML API.
Instead of straight up using a clean response I need to convert the XML to an object with **xml-2-json** and then clean up the thing that says *items[0].item.$.value*.
With the data the app can display all the games in all our collections inside a lazy-loaded FlatList.

You can make a game night in the app by selecting a date and the players.
If someone doesn't have a BGG user, you can just add an empty player to get the correct amount of players.

**TODO or not TODO**

The whole Tinder part is still a work in progress. You can view games, but you can't vote yet.
I'm also unsure how I'd go with the whole authentication thing, so that the players who are attending the
game night can come join the vote.
I haven't really worked with the UI design yet, so the app is very ugly.
