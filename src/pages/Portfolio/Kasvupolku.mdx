**Description**

**Kasvupolku** was a new in-house mobile application development at **NordicEdu**/**Rainmaker**.

The aim was to make the introduction process for new employees easier and to motivate them to learn about their new employer and their ways of working.
One of the project's ambitious goals was that the app would not be used only during introduction, but to have content and tasks for the whole duration of employment at the company.

I left before the app was released, so I'm not sure what's going on with the project these days.

**Technical stuff**

Kasvupolku was my first professional project using **React Native** and **GraphQL**.
I had tried React Native before, but this project was my first touch on **functional programming** so I took on the project as a great learning opportunity.
