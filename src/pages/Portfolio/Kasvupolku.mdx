**Description**

Kasvupolku is a new development by NordicEdu made for Rainmaker.
The aim is to make the introduction of new employees easier and to motivate these new workers to learn new things about the ways of their new employer.
Your "growth path" doesn't end to intros, which means the Kasvupolku app is designed to be used during your whole career at the company.

The app hasn't had its first release yet, so there isn't much else I can tell.

**Technical stuff**

Kasvupolku was my first professional project using **React Native** and **GraphQL**.
It had a pretty steep learning curve, since at the same time it was my first proper introduction to **Functional Programming**.
